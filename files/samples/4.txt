[The mission of the Scripps Translational Science Institute (STSI) is to innovate, transform and fully integrate clinical and translational research. The Scripps Translational Science Institute connects the facilities of Scripps Health with the facilities of The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI). The Scripps Translational Science Institute (STSI), in conjunction with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) consortium is transforming how clinical and translational research is conducted, ultimately enabling researchers to provide new treatments more efficiently and quickly to patients. The vision of our program provides solutions to these obstacles, with the appropriate amalgam of “integration and innovation,” and the remarkable opportunity to capitalize on particular strengths at Scripps and partnering institutions have led to the development of 4 over-arching goals of the STSI (the 4 “I’s”). Ignite the spirit of discovery of highly-charged interdisciplinary research, coupling translational, clinical and community-based investigation. Inspire trainees and young faculty through innovative curriculum and learning experiences, promoting not only scientific productivity but dedicated translational research and education career paths. Integrate the efforts at TSRI and Scripps Health and partnering institutions in the community by building on existing programs, in the pursuit of unprecedented engagement of the population of San Diego. Infrastructure and informatics buildup to potentiate and accelerate the ambitious needs of the program.
