Intuition : "A query can be treated as a center or mean of a random cluster. Perspective is to have a search engine which returns results that lie around the query (center of that random cluster). If our search has improved, then query vector should be closer to the mean of cluster of search results returned by Release 1.3, than the counterpart mean of Release 1.2.1 respectively. "

Expectation: "Results from Release 1.3 should be tightly clustered and have their mean vector close to query vector."

Approach :

1) Install Release 1.2.1 and 1.3 
2) Load scripps on both instances
3) run same search query on both instances
4) Generate text files of first 10 search results from both the instances.
5) Make a combined dictionary of total words appear in both search results ( on 1.2.1 and 1.3).
6) Parse all text files generated in step 4. 
7) Form sample vector for each file using "Bag of words" theory. (Ref: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_of_words_model_in_computer_vision ).
8) Form query vector ( call it Q).
9) Normalize all vectors.
10) Treat results from Release 1.2.1 ( corresponding vectors) as a part of one cluster and derive its mean vector ( call it M1).
11) Treat results from Release 1.3 ( corresponding vectors) as a part of another cluster and derive its mean vector ( call it M2).
12) Use some distance measure and Calculate Q - M1 & Q - M2

Successful search improvement if : (Q - M1) > (Q-M2) in most of the cases.
